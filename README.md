### Tech
LeaningIsFun  uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Font Awesome] - awesome web-based text editor
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* jQuery, Node.js..etc


And of course LearningisFun itself is open source with a [public repository]
 on GitHub.
